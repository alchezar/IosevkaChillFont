## Iosevka Kinder Fonts

### **Iosevka Kinder Clear** 
[Font repository](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka?tab=readme-ov-file)  
My own take on what a perfect font look like. I've been looking for something similar for a long time, but I had to do it myself.  
The font has clean look without unnecessary serifs on characters.   
In my humble opinion, this is perfect font for people with imperfect vision. Compared to other fonts, it's letters are larger, while keeping the same number of lines on the screen.

### **Iosevka Kinder Nerd** 
[Patcher repository](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)  
The patched version of the Clear font with a large number of glyphs.  
All icons, glyphs and symbols display correctly in terminal or nvim.
