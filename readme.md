## Iosevka Chill Fonts

### **[Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka?tab=readme-ov-file) Chill**
  
My own take on what a perfect font look like. I've been looking for something similar for a long time, but I had to do it myself.  
The font has clean look without unnecessary serifs on characters.   
In my humble opinion, this is perfect font for people with imperfect vision. Compared to other fonts, it's letters are larger, while keeping the same number of lines on the screen.

The patched version of the Chill font with a large number of glyphs.  
All icons, glyphs and symbols display correctly in terminal or nvim.
